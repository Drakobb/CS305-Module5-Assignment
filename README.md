# CS305-Module5-Assignment
Assignment for module 5
A project I really want to continue working on is website that I have been creating over the past couple of weeks.
I want to use this website as a kind of portfolio to showcase my future projects and also have links to my resume
and linken profiles. I want it to be a showcase of my skills using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For this project I am using
the MIT license.

Module Contribution
To contribute to this project, I have decided to add a module that not only boosts the efficiency of his website, but also 
better displays his skills as a website programmer. It adds a user input that changes the outcome of the website.
Essentially, it is a website that leads to many more websites. The user will be given options that are key words
that when entered will lead to a specific information site or something like that. For example, if the user input 
something like "Health and Wellness" it would lead them to a website full of training regiments, nutrition tips,
and inspirational quotes. I am excited to add my contributions to Drakes great ideas.
